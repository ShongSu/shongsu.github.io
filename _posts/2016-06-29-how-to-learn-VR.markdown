There are 3 main parts of Virtual Reality in general.

##  Native VR App

1) Game Engine - Unity

You have to learn `C#` and `Javascript`.

If you are a newbie of programming, [DOM Scripting: Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model][jsdom] and [Eloquent JavaScript][ejs] would be a good start.

If you already have programming experience, [JavaScript: The Good Parts][jstgp] is a best choice.

For Unity, you may follow [Roll-a-ball tutorial][rab] offered by Unity3D official website. Then, [Oculus Developer Center Documentation][odc] may give you more detail.

2) The tutorials above are all related to VR output device, if you are interested in VR input device, such as UI/UX of VR, `Leap Motion` (`Oculus touch` or `HTC Vive`) is a good choice.

3) Besides of programming background, you also need some mathematical knowledge, [Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Application：A Programmer’s Guide，Second Edition][emfg] are recommended.


##  VR Movies

VR Movies is another part of VR, you may Google "VR camera rig" for more information if you are interested.

##  VR Web

You need learn [three.js][3js] at first. `three.js` is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. The source code is hosted in a repository on [GitHub][3jsgit].

Then you can follow [borismus/webvr-boilerplate][webvrb] project on Github to build a sample VR website. Remember you should use `Chromium` or `Mozilla nightly` to test you site, take [webvr.info][webvr] for reference. In addition, [Hello-Cannon.js!][hcj] is another interesting project.
