Thanks to an interview opportunity from SurveyMonkey, I learnt this website: [Codility][c]. It is an amazing place to provide online coding test to software companies. But as a programmer, we also can test ourselves from the [lessons][le] and [challenges][ch] it provided. 


It supports mostly programming language, including C, C++, Java, Pascal, Python, C#, PHP, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, VB.NET, Lua, Objective-C, Scala and Go.


In addition, it will evaluate your code by correctness and performance, such as,

It also run your code in many test cases to avoid overflow or edge data to ensure your code without little bugs.
Detials as below,
